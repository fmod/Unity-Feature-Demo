Welcome to this FMOD Feature Demo!
----------------------------------

Tested with Unity 2021.2 and FMOD 2.02 on Windows, Mac, Linux.

This project demonstrates a wide range of features found in FMOD and some examples of how you can utilize them in your own project.

***FMOD for Unity has been removed from the project, [download](https://fmod.com/download) and install the latest version for it to work.***

After downloading the project:

1. Install FMOD for Unity.
2. [Link FMOD to the supplied banks](https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-unity?version=2.01&page=user-guide.html#using-a-single-platform-build) found in "Assets\FMODBanks\Desktop".
3. Open the 'Overworld v2.0' scene.
4. Press play.

Key tips while playing:

- Using headphones will enhance the experience and give you a better understanding of what is happening.

- Press ESC ('P' while in the editor) for the Main Menu, and ESC again to close it.

- Options (Graphics Settings/Volume Controls) are available in the Main Menu.

- Teleporting to each room is possible through the Main Menu.

- Floating FMOD logo's around the world will give you more information when activated by looking directly at them.

- All the sounds in the project are using FMOD Studio and the FMOD Unity Integration.

In every custom script containing FMOD, you will see this comment structure before the lines that refer to FMOD:

```
  /*===============================================Fmod====================================================
